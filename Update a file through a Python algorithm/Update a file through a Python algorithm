-- Activity Overview --

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read Create a cybersecurity portfolio.

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the Create another algorithm lab that you have just completed. You will explain the code you developed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 



-- Scenario --

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

Note: This scenario involves developing the same algorithm that is developed in Tasks 2-7 of the Create another algorithm lab. (You do not need to reference Task 1 and Tasks 8-10 of the lab to complete this portfolio activity.) You should revisit the lab to get screenshots to include in your portfolio document. 



-- Step-By-Step Instructions --

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the 9 questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.


Step 1: Access the template

To use the template for this course item, click the link and select Use Template. (In this step, you will just open the template. More instructions for how to use the template will be included in later steps.)


Step 2: Access supporting materials

The following supporting material will help you complete this activity. The document Instructions for including Python code provides instructions and best practices for including samples of Python code in your portfolio activity. Keep it open as you proceed to the next steps.

To use the supporting material for this course item, click the link and select Use Template. 


Step 3: Open the file that contains the allow list

The file that you want to open is called "allow_list.txt". Assign a string containing this file name to the import_file variable. Then, use a with statement to open it. Use the variable file to store the file while you work with it inside the with statement.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the Open the file that contains the allow list section of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. In the Task 2 section of Create another algorithm lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.


Step 4: Read the file contents

Next, use the .read() method to convert the contents of the allow list file into a string so that you can read them. Store this string in a variable called ip_addresses.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the Read the file contents section of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. In the Task 3 section of the Create another algorithm lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.


Step 5: Convert the string into a list

In order to remove individual IP addresses from the allow list, the IP addresses need to be in a list format. Therefore, use the .split() method to convert the ip_addresses string into a list.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the Convert the string into a list section of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. In the Task 4 section of the Create another algorithm lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.


Step 6: Iterate through the remove list

A second list called remove_list contains all of the IP addresses that should be removed from the ip_addresses list. Set up the header of a for loop that will iterate through the remove_list. Use element as the loop variable.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the Iterate through the remove list section of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. In the Task 5 section of the Create another algorithm lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.


Step 7: Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list

In the body of your iterative statement, add code that will remove all the IP addresses from the allow list that are also on the remove list. First, create a conditional that evaluates if the loop variable element is part of the ip_addresses list. Then, within that conditional, apply the .remove() method to the ip_addresses list and remove the IP addresses identified in the loop variable element. 

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list section of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. In the Task 6 section of the Create another algorithm lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.

In addition, include a sentence that explains that applying the .remove() method in this way is possible because there are no duplicates in the ip_addresses list. 


Step 8: Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses

Now that you have removed these IP addresses from the ip_address variable, you can complete the algorithm by updating the file with this revised list. To do this, you must first convert the ip_addresses list back into a string using the .join() method. Apply .join() to the string "\n" in order to separate the elements in the file by placing them on a new line.

Then, use another with statement and the .write() method to write over the file assigned to the import_file variable.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses section of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. In the Task 7 section of the Create another algorithm lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.


Step 9: Finalize your document

To finalize the document and make its purpose clear to potential employers, be sure to complete the Project description and Summary sections of the Algorithm for file updates in Python template. 

In the Project description section, give a general overview of the scenario and what you accomplished in Python. Write three to five sentences.

In the Summary section, provide a short summary of the algorithm by highlighting its main components. Write four to six sentences.


Pro Tip: Save a copy of your work
