-- Activity Overview --

In this activity, you will analyze a suspicious email and identify signs of a phishing attack. Then, you will determine whether the email should be allowed or quarantined. 

Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of social engineering that you’ll encounter in the field. Identifying phishing attempts will help you prevent threats and find ways to improve security procedures.


-- Scenario --

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You’re a security analyst at an investment firm called Imaginary Bank. An executive at the firm recently received a spear phishing email that appears to come from the board of Imaginary Bank. Spear phishing is a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source. In this case, the executive is being asked to install new collaboration software, ExecuTalk.

The executive suspects this email might be a phishing attempt because ExecuTalk was never mentioned during the last board meeting. They've forwarded the message to your team to verify if it’s legitimate. Your supervisor has tasked you with investigating the message and determining whether it should be quarantined.


Step 1: Analyze the suspicious email

From: imaginarybank@gmail.org
Sent: Saturday, December 21, 2019  15:05:05
To: cfo@imaginarybank.com
Subject:  RE: You are been added to an ecsecutiv's groups

Step 2: Examine the sender's information

Next, examine the major parts of this message in closer detail starting with the email header. You can often find clues in the message header that indicate you are dealing with a phishing attack.

Examine the email header of this suspicious message:

From: imaginarybank@gmail.org
Sent: Saturday, December 21, 2019  15:05:05
To: cfo@imaginarybank.com
Subject:  RE: You are been added to an ecsecutiv's groups

Pro tip: Always check the domain name that comes after the @ symbol. Requests for sensitive information or asking you to download files should not come from personal accounts, like @gmail.com, @icloud, @yahoo.com or others.


Which two clues in the message header indicate to you that this is a phishing attempt?
· The sender is using a different domain.
· There is a misspelling in the subject line.

Two clues in the message header that indicate that this is a phishing attempt are that there is a misspelling in the subject line and the sender is using a different domain. Phishing emails commonly contain glaring spelling and grammatical errors. Another typical sign of phishing is when messages come from external domains, like a personal Gmail account.


Step 3: Review the message body for clues

Next, review the body of the message received by the executive at Imaginary Bank. Try to identify three ways this threat actor tried to disguise their message as a legitimate email.

Note: This message is strictly meant to illustrate an example of an email that contains malicious download options.

What details make this message appear legitimate?
· The title of the group
· The brand labeling
· The download options for major operating systems

The brand labeling, the download options for major operating systems, and the title of the group, are all details that make this message appear legitimate.


Step 4: Investigate  the download options

Phishing emails often contain links that redirect to malicious sites or trigger malware downloads.

Pro tip: When investigating suspicious emails, hovering your mouse cursor over buttons will reveal the URL they redirect to without having to click them. This is the safest way to check if it will take you to a suspicious domain or if it links to an http:// URL that isn’t secure.

In this case, the message contains three download options. Each of them opens this login form:


The URL is the main clue that indicates this form is malicious. Threat actors make this difficult to spot by design. When accessing SaaS services, like Microsoft applications, the URL typically includes the organization’s domain.
