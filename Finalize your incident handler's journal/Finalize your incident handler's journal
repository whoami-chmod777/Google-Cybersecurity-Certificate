- What to Include in Your Response -

Be sure to address the following in your completed activity: 

- 4 completed journal entries, with the Date, Entry, and Description section filled in (50-80 words)
- 2 of the 4 entries document an incident investigation in the The 5 W's section (4-6 sentences or bullet points)
- 2 of the 4 entries outline the use of a cybersecurity tool in the Tool(s) used section (3-5 sentences or bullet points)
- The Reflections/Notes section addresses the reflection prompt (6-9 sentences or bullets)

Note: Some of these items may be addressed in the same journal entry. For example, a journal entry might contain descriptions about a cybersecurity tool and the 5 W's of an incident.


# Step 2: Assess your activity

The following is a self-assessment for your incident handler's journal. You will use these statements to review your own work. The self-assessment process is an important part of the learning experience because it allows you to objectively assess your incident handler's journal.

There are a total of 5 points possible for this activity, and each statement is worth 1 point. The items correspond to each step you completed for the activity. 

To complete the self-assessment, first open your incident handler's journal. Then respond yes or no to each statement. 

When you complete and submit your responses, you will receive a percentage score. This score will help you confirm whether you completed the required steps of the activity. The recommended passing grade for this project is at least 80% (or 4/5 points). If you want to increase your score, you can revise your project and then resubmit your responses to reflect any changes you made. Try to achieve at least 4 points before continuing on to the next course item.
