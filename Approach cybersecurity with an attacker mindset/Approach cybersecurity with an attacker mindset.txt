-- Activity Overview --

Now that you've been introduced to attack surfaces and attack vectors, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will think about how these factors can help identify threats and respond to brief questions. 

You have learned many skills and concepts in this course. Completing this self-reflection will help you understand how you might use what you’ve learned for different tasks and roles in the security field. Answering and asking questions in this self-reflection will help to reinforce what you’ve learned, so it will be easier for you to remember it later.


-- Review the steps of applying an attacker mindset --

Previously, you learned that applying an attacker mindset to any situation starts by asking yourself, “How would I exploit this vector?” This will require you to consider two elements: the attack surface and its attack vectors.

Remember, an attack surface includes all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit. An attack vector is the pathway that an attacker uses to penetrate security defenses of an attack surface.

After considering these elements, you can then go through a step-by-step process to apply an attacker mindset: 

· Identify a target
· Determine how the target can be accessed
· Evaluate attack vectors that can be exploited
· Find the tools and methods of attack

For a refresher on the elements of an attacker mindset, you can review the video on attack vectors and the video on attack surfaces.


-- Reflection --

Consider what you reviewed about applying an attacker mindset in relation to securing your home environment: 

· What are the attack surfaces of a home? Are they physical or digital? What are their vulnerabilities? Are they currently exposed to risk?

1.Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) that describe important characteristics about the attack surfaces of your home. Type your response in the text box.

The attack surfaces of a home encompass both physical and digital aspects. Physical attack surfaces include doors, windows, and other entry points, while digital attack surfaces involve networked devices like smart home systems and routers. Vulnerabilities may include weak locks, outdated software, or insecure Wi-Fi networks. Regular security assessments can identify potential risks and exposure to threats, allowing for proactive mitigation.

#Correct
Evaluating an attack surface is critical to understanding the operational environment you're in. By considering a system as a whole, you're better equipped to identify parts of the system that need to be reviewed more closely for security vulnerabilities.


Next, consider how an attacker might exploit the vulnerabilities of that surface.

· What are the attack vectors of this surface? Are there multiple entry points? How might the vulnerabilities be exploited? What defenses exist? Can new defenses be added?

2. Now, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) that explain what those attack vectors are and how you can apply the tools and/or strategies you’ve learned to protect your home. Type your response in the text box.

Attack vectors for a home can include physical entry through doors or windows, as well as digital vectors like exploiting weak passwords or compromising smart home devices. Implementing strong physical security measures such as robust locks and alarms addresses the physical vectors. For digital vectors, securing Wi-Fi with strong passwords, updating software regularly, and using firewalls can fortify defenses. Applying the knowledge of attack vectors and surfaces helps in adopting a comprehensive security approach for both physical and digital aspects of home protection.

# Correct

Great work strengthening your understanding of an attacker mindset with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would consider the wide range of attack vectors that can be used to exploit an attack surface and how the risk of an attack can be proactively reduced.

Applying an attacker mindset requires you to view the world differently. Most things are made with the assumption they’ll be used as they were designed. As a security professional, it’s important to always think about how things can be misused or abused. Doing so is key to reducing the likelihood of a security risk and having a solid plan.
